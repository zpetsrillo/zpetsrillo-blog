[Kenshin187 Portfolio Site](https://kenshin187-dev.web.app/)

## Kenshin187 Art Site

A simple web page to display some of Kenshin187’s work and provide information on pricing for commissions and links to social media.

### Motivations

When visiting a friend, I met his roommate who turned out to be a successful artist. Impressed by his art I asked whether he had a personal website or needed any help technology wise in running his business. He said that he had never gotten around to getting one as he had been overwhelmed by demand for his art. This seemed like a good opportunity to put my programming skills to work towards helping someone out.

### Goals

Kenshin187 was unsure what I had to offer and didn’t know what to expect. He also wasn’t very interested in anything fancy. A minimalistic site to present some art and information was all he really wanted. I saw a few essential things that the site should contain.

- Gallery displaying some of his best work
- Information on his pricing
- Links to contact him and view his social media

### Dependencies

- Angular
- Colcade
- Firebase

Using Angular for this site might seem a bit over the top as it’s a relatively simple page. I did this just in case he asks me to expand the site in the future once he gets a better idea of what I could build. I knew that displaying his work as soon as the homepage loads would be most important. To help present the work I used Colcade, a simple library for creating a masonry layout. While there are a couple of issues I ran into using it, it does the job well enough for what the site needs to be. Lastly I used firebase. While the site currently does not use any of the database functionalities of firebase, again it prepares the site for any future expansion. Firebase is currently only being used for hosting, as I’ve worked with it before and makes the process simple for me.
