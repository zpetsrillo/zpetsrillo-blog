When using YouTube for listneing to music, I felt that a few features for playlists were lacking. I built this small project in order to test my ideas and improve my own experience.

Learning form my experience on building the site for the Boy Scouts, I decided to use Angular and Firestore for this project. I'm also using the YouTube data API. I've also come to appreciate the importance of getting an MVP done as soon as possible. I rushed to get an MVP up and running for this site first. Now that I have the base completed. I can look to add features from here. Trying to build too much at once can lead to unexcpected problems as you go. It also means spending longer beofre you have something presentable which can make it feel as though you're not actually making much progress and demotivate you.

I'm very happy with the progress I've made so far. This porject has gone much smoother than the Boy Scout project. I have plenty of other ideas to implement going forward. Building something that solves a problem I'm experiencing has made the project much more interesting and motivating. I intend to keep imporving this site until it's my personal favorite listening experience.
