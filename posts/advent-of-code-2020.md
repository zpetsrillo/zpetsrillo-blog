### What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is a public yearly coding challenge competition that is held online. On each day leading up to Christmas, a coding problem with 2 parts is released at midnight. Each problem fits into a larger story that is Christmas themed. The challenges get progressively more difficult as Christmas approaches.

### My experience

This was my first year competing in Advent of Code and it was some of the most fun I've had with coding. The problems were interesting and made for excellent practice. While I'm not nearly good enough to have scored competitively on it, solving the problems was rewarding enough. A friend competed along side me and it was fun to share our thoughts on the problems and compare solutions. I would recommend anyone with an interest in code to participate. Solving the problems from previous years is good, but doesn't capture the magic of refreshing the page at midnight, eager to read through the problem and get to work.
