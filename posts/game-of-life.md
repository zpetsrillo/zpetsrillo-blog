While browsing hacker news, I saw a [post that talked about Conway's game](http://www.amandaghassaei.com/blog/2020/05/01/the-recursive-universe/). I had never heard of Conway's game before, but it looked interesting. I decided it might be a fun weekend project to build the game in a simple web app.
