## Vigenere Cipher Cracker

[Github Link](https://github.com/zpetsrillo/vigenere-cipher)

Python class to crack a simple vigenere cipher.

## About

This program was built in order to complete [Level 5 of the Krypton wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/krypton5.html). I had fun writing this code and was happy with that it worked in successfully discovering the password.

## Assumptions

- Data for the program is in English and known to be real words.
- Data is not case sensitive and only contains letters.
- Data is known to use the same key.
